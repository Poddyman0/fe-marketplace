<strong>Project Title:</strong> NC Marketplace

<strong>Overview:</strong>
Northcoders set out to develop an online marketplace to help users find new homes for unused items. The aim was to create a platform where users can list and purchase items, with a focus on making item discovery easier through effective categorization. The project emphasized a user-friendly design and a responsive interface to ensure usability on various devices.

<strong>Project Description:</strong>
In this project, I was tasked with delivering a prototype for the NC Marketplace. This involved building a React-based frontend that communicates with a backend API. The frontend was designed to handle item listings, purchases, and user management, all while being mobile-first to provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
